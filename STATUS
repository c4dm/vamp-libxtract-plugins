Status of libxtract features implemented via vamp-libxtract.

A feature is described as "plausible" if it runs without crashing on a
test audio file in Sonic Visualiser and produces real valued results
that are not always zero and look (to the uneducated) as if they might
be in a sensible range.

A features is "suspect" if it returns results but they look like
they're all over the place.  Other failures are marked accordingly.  I
have no idea whether these fail in SV, the plugin, or the extraction
code.  The ones that seem to need investigating are marked with a *.

For simple features like mean, variance etc the plugin just extracts
the feature from the spectrum magnitudes of each block.

    MEAN		  Plausible
    VARIANCE		  Plausible
    STANDARD_DEVIATION	  Plausible
    AVERAGE_DEVIATION	  Plausible
    SKEWNESS		* Suspect
    KURTOSIS		* Suspect
    CENTROID		  Plausible
    IRREGULARITY_K	* All zeroes
    IRREGULARITY_J	* No data
    TRISTIMULUS_1	  Not implemented (no harmonic spectrum input)
    TRISTIMULUS_2	  Not implemented (no harmonic spectrum input)

    SMOOTHNESS		  Plausible
    SPREAD		  Plausible
    ZCR			  Plausible
    ROLLOFF		* Not sure (does produce some data)
    LOUDNESS		* Does not complete (wild value exposes SV bug?)
    FLATNESS		  Plausible
